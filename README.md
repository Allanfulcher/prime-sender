## Build Process (Using `build.sh`)

To build the extension for both local (normal) and production (obfuscated) environments, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following commands/tools are installed:

- `grep`: Used for extracting the version from `manifest.json`.
- `zip`: For creating the ZIP packages.
- `javascript-obfuscator`: For obfuscating JavaScript files in the production build. Install it using:
  
```bash
npm install -g javascript-obfuscator
```
 
### Building the Extension

Run the `build.sh` script to generate both normal and obfuscated builds:

```bash
./build.sh
```

### What the Script Does?

1. **Checks for required commands**: Ensures that `grep`, `zip`, and `javascript-obfuscator` are installed.
2. **Extracts version**: Fetches the extension version from the `manifest.json` file. If unavailable, it uses the provided `{DEFAULT_VERSION}`.
3. **Normal build**:
   - Creates a normal build by copying all files and zipping them into a file named `Prime-Sender-v{VERSION}-Normal.zip`.
4. **Production (obfuscated) build**:
   - Copies all files, excluding those defined in `{PROD_IGNORED_FILES}`.
   - Obfuscates the specified JavaScript files listed in `P{ROD_OBFUSCATED_JS_FILES}`.
   - Creates a production build with obfuscated code and zips it into a file named `Prime-Sender-v{VERSION}-Obfuscated.zip`.

> Note: Both ZIP files will be saved in the parent directory.
